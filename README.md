# deep-carlsen-samyak

Week 1: I focused on learning the basics of Python through Mosh's tutorial, which provided a strong foundation for my coding skills. I also explored Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, which helped me understand code organization and reusability.

Week 2: I delved into deep learning frameworks like Tensorflow and PyTorch. After evaluating both options, I decided to concentrate on Tensorflow. I followed a Tensorflow tutorial to learn how to build neural networks and handle data. I also curated a list of additional reading materials to expand my knowledge.

Week 3: I dedicated this week to thoroughly reading the research paper that forms the basis of my project. By understanding the proposed ideas, algorithms, and methodologies, I developed a rough implementation plan. This plan outlines the key steps and components needed to bring the research paper's concepts to life.

Week 4: With a solid understanding of the research paper and a rough implementation plan in hand, I started the actual implementation of the deep learning concepts from the paper using Tensorflow. I began by setting up the project structure and organizing the code based on the principles of OOP that I learned earlier. This helped me maintain a clean and modular codebase.

Week 5: By the fifth week, I had made significant progress with the implementation. I successfully created and trained the neural network model according to the specifications mentioned in the research paper. I also ran extensive tests to ensure that the model's performance matched the results reported in the paper. This involved comparing loss values, accuracy, and other relevant metrics.

Week 6: As the final week of the project approached, I shifted my focus to documentation and code refinement. I thoroughly documented each step of the implementation process, explaining the reasoning behind design choices and the results obtained. This documentation will be helpful for myself and others who might work on this project in the future.
